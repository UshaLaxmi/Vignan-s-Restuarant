# Vignan-s-Restuarant
 The objective of the "Vignan's Restaurant" project was to create a web-based application that simulates the operations of a restaurant, with a focus on automating the billing and receipt generation process. The application provides an interface for customers to browse the menu, place orders, and receive an itemized bill.
